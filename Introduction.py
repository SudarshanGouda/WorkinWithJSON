############ JASON ##########################
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on
JavaScript object syntax.

####### Why JASON are Used   ####################

It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications
(e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).
You'll come across it quite often, so in this article, we give you all you need to work with JSON

############## What problem Jason Solves ################
JSON is self-describing. The syntax and hierarchical structure of the JSON strings can in some cases be interpreted by applications that do not already know what data to expect.
JSON is simple text. This fact makes it suitable and safe for transferring across platforms and operating systems that do not readily share more complex document types. As text, JSON can also be readily displayed and edited in simple editors.
JSON is compact. An average JSON string is about two thirds of the size of the same data in XML.
JSON is easy to learn, easy to read, and easy to understand.
